## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using fixed heights tends to cause more problems it solves, so I found that removing this made the component more responsive with less code.

Centering the element vertically was a challenge. After trying several options, I found that making the containers flex containers and changing the axis to vertical was the easiest solution.

### Useful resources

- [Centering Position](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6626314/center-an-item-with-position-relative) - This stack overflow thread helped me find a solution to vertical centering.
